            <p>An explosive is a substance that releases alot of energy in a short amount of time in the form of heat, sound and light when detonated, or activated. Different explosives have different properties such as shock resistance, gas released, the heat generated and much more. The three types of explosive are mechanical, chemical, and nuclear explosives. Mechanical explosives explode via built up pressure and other physical energy build ups that release energy such as a compressed air can. Chemical explosives are the traditional explosives you think about. They have alot of chemical stored up which is released when the explosive is detonated. This website will mostly focus on chemical explosives. Nuclear explosives explode via energy from nuclear reactions. Almost all nuclear explosives were made for warfare and have no commercial use.</p>
