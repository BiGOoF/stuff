            <h1>Nuclear Explosives</h1>
            <p>Nuclear explosives are explosives that generate energy not from high energy chemical bonds, but nuclear reactions. Almost all nuclear explosives ever created were made for war and destruction. Nuclear explosives cause massive damage to cities and can kill millions of people with just one bomb. Nuclear bombs are considered to be extremely powerful weapons of mass destruction.</p>
            <h3>Fission bombs</h3>
            <p>Fission bombs also known as atomic bombs are nuclear bombs that derive their energy from splitting unstable atoms such as Uranium and Plutonium. These cause massive immediate damage, but they also cause a massive fallout for many years that leaves the area inhabitable. These bombs can release energy equal to 500 kilotons of TNT per bomb. Little boy and fat man were both fission bombs. The two designs of Fission bombs are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The gun-type assembly method. The gun-type assembly method is the oldest method, and it works on a chemical explosive exploding and compressing the uranium, then releasing the energy and causing a massive release of energy.</li>

	            <li>The implosion assembly method. The implosion assembly method is more advanced and powerful than the gun-type assembly method. They work by exploding lenses compressing a chunk of plutonium, causing it to implode and release massive amounts of energy. The more plutonium that is compressed before the bomb implodes, the more energy it releases.</li>

	        </ul>
            <h3>Thermonuclear bombs</h3>
            <p>Thermonuclear, also known as fusion or hydrogen bombs are more sophisticated and destructive than fission bombs. They work by using a smaller fission reaction to trigger a more powerful fusion reaction, releasing alot more energy than a fission bomb. They work mostly via a small implosion fission bomb triggering a fusion reaction, releasing alot more energy than just the fission bomb by itself. The most powerful nuclear bomb ever created, the tsar bomba, is a thermonuclear bomb.</p>
