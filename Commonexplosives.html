            <h1>Common Explosives</h1>
  
            <p>Common explosives are explosives that are well known and used often like TNT and dynamite, along with other substances. Different explosives have different properties for different purposes.
            Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                TNT also known as trinitrotoluene, is useful for its resistance to shock and friction meaning it is alot easier to control and alot safer. It is commonly used now for military, industrial, and mining purposes, but has some limited uses due to the fact that TNT is extremely toxic.

	            <li>
                Dynamite which is NOT the same thing as TNT but actually nitroglycerine, which is reactive and will blow up if you expose it to shock and friction. It has alot of uses, including medicine for blood vessel dilation, a component in some gunpowders, and it is also used for industrial and mining purposes.

                <img src = "Dynamite.jpg" width="533"  height="300"  alt= "Dynamite">
	            </li><li>
                RDX which stands for Research Department explosive. It is the main explosive component of the C-4 plastic explosive. It is resistant to physical shock meaning it is good as a powerful controlled explosive.
	            </li><li>
	            <img src = "RDX.jpg" width="320"  height="240"  alt= "RDX">
                </li><li>
	            HMX also known as octogen is a relatively unsensitive explosive that is used for missile heads and armour piercing charges. It is chemically similar to RDX.
	            </li><li>

                </li><li>
	            Gunpowder is a mixture of sulphur, charcoal, and salpeter. It was the first explosive invented, invented in 9th century China. It is a moderately reactive powder that is used as a propellant in some rockets, fireworks, and firearms due to the fact that it produces alot of gas and heat, meaning it produces alot of thrust making it good to launch/propel things.
